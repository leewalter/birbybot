### Building a Twitter Bot with Flickr and GCP

Hello, what's up GDG San Francisco? How's everyone's DevFest going so far?

My name is Rachel Ramsay, and today I'll be sharing what I learned while building a Twitter image bot with the Flickr API and Google Cloud Platform, particularly the Cloud Vision API.

I should warn you that I'm on call right now, so apologies in advance if I get paged.

I love birdwatching, and my journey into bot-making began when I tweeted a simple question.

## Slide 1
### A Simple Question

"What if I made a bot that exclusively posted pictures of plovers and their babies?"

(If you don't know what a plover is, it's a shorebird, and its babies are adorable.)

## Slide 2
### @beachbirbys

I ended up making beachbirbys, for all your beach bird baby needs.

Today, I'm going to tell you what I learned while building beachbirbys, and share some resources for building your own bot.

I hope that you come away with the inspiration and guidance to build something that makes you feel good.

## Slide 3
### A Simple Plan

My goals for this bot were simple:

1. Get pictures of plover babies from Flickr.
2. Post those pictures to Twitter.
3. Feel the good chemical spraying everywhere in my brain.

## Slide 4
### Problem #1

When I started this project, I had to decide how I would approach copyrighted material. Some people's approach is more blas√© &mdash; they figure they'll get some DMCA takedowns and maybe their bot will be suspended; whatever happens, happens.

But, for me, crediting photographers and not reposting copyrighted images were priorities.

As a follower of image bots, I'm often frustrated by not knowing how to find more work by whoever created what I'm seeing, so I wanted my bot to link back to its sources.

## Slide 5
### Solution #1

I chose Flickr as my image source because of its strong support for attribution and Creative Commons licenses.

## Slide 6
### Searching Flickr

So, with the goal of seeing more pictures of baby plovers on my timeline, I said to Flickr, "Show me baby plovers."

And I got back...

## Slide 7
### That's not a bird...

A baby turtle.

Flickr's API _did_ return baby plovers, but it also returned this turtle. As cute as this turtle is, I don't want my bot to post it.

So, why did it appear in my results?

## Slide 8
### _[Read]_ Flickr returns photos that contain the search term in their title, description, or tags

This image is titled "_Baby_ bog turtle," and its description includes the word "plover".

## Slide 9
### ...threatened and endangered species that occur in Connecticut, including the threatened bog turtle, piping plover, and Puritan tiger beetle...

If you were building a tiger image bot, this turtle might appear in those search results, too!

So, now we have a problem.

## Slide 10
### Problem #2

There wasn't a good solution within the Flickr API to make sure that my bot never tweeted a non-bird photo by accident.

Now, there weren't _that_ many search results. I _could_ have sorted the birds from the non-birds by hand.

But I didn't do that, because when given a choice between doing the thing myself and spending many hours making the computer do the thing, I will always choose the latter.

## Slide 11
### Cloud Vision API

Ultimately, I decided to take all of the results returned by Flickr and run them through Cloud Vision API.

Cloud Vision API is great because it already knows what a bird is; it already knows what a lot of things are because its image recognition models are already trained.

## Slide 12
### Approach #1

Label detection evaluates the image as a whole.

When we run our baby box turtle through label detection, we know it's not a bird.

## Slide 13
### Definitely not a bird

(Those numbers are confidence scores.)

But because label detection evaluates the image as a whole, it can miss things.

## Slide 14
### But this is a bird

For this image, label detection only sees sand; it misses the adorable piping plover chick that I can plainly see with my human eyes.

In order for Cloud Vision API to see the plover, I turned to Object Localization.

## Slide 15
### Approach #2

In addition to detecting objects, object localization does some rudimentary categorization.

## Slide 16
### Well, it's definitely something...

Sometimes object localization _does_ recognize an object as a bird, but for our photo of a baby plover on the beach, it was like, "Eh, I think we got an animal here."

But I can use that bounding poly to crop the image and run it through label detection again.

## Slide 17
### Solution #2

When I do _that_, label detection recognizes the plover as a bird, which is good enough for my bot to use it.

That said,

## Slide 18
### Problem #3

Detecting and labeling objects is not bulletproof.

It's a good strategy, but it can still fail.

## Slide 19
### Doesn't look like anything to me

Nature has this thing called camouflage.

While my human eyes can pick out the spotted sandpiper hatchlings, Cloud Vision API is only vaguely sensing the presence of fauna.

## Slide 20
### After cropping

When I crop this time, I actually get further away from correct classification: now Cloud Vision API detects no animal presence at all; we've lost that fauna label.

## Slide 21
### Cloud AutoML Vision

Enter Cloud AutoML for Vision, which is designed to simplify training your own image classification models.

## Slide 22
### Solution #3?

I have not trained a model to distinguish camouflaged fauna from flora...yet.

I turned to Cloud Vision precisely because I didn't want to train my own models.

How deep does this rabbit hole go?

## Slide 23
### Birds, But Make It Spooky

In this demo, we're going to build up a simple script that will find and tweet photos of bats because it's almost Halloween!

_[Cmd+tab to switch to Visual Studio Code.]_

## Demo

_[Control+g **116** Enter]_

The first thing we're doing is instantiating our clients and searching Flickr for bats.

The license parameter is selecting various Creative Commons licenses.

We've got safe search turned on...

...dates that I hope will surface some good cases...

Then we'll take these results and use them to create entities for our datastore.

Cloud Datastore entities have Keys made up of a Kind and a Name. We're going to call this kind of entity Photos, and we're going to make the name part of the key their source API &mdash; in this case, Flickr &mdash; plus the UUID from that API.

We'll add a few extra properties to our Flickr results...

Update the entity with everything returned by the Flickr API...

Convert this timestamp string into a Python datetime...

Finally, Flickr has a few different image sizes, but they were introduced at different times, so not all photos come in all sizes &mdash; that's why we have a helper function to pick the best download url available.

_[Control+g **303** Enter]_

So, we'll get our search results for the word "bat," then we'll turn those results into entities.

We're also going to open our photos so that we know what it is we have to classify.

Once we have our entities, we _could_ write them to the datastore, then come back later and ask the datastore for entities where is_classified is False, but we'll just classify them first and write them after that.

####_Your code block should look like_

```
    pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter()
    
    photos = search_flickr("bat")
    entities = photos_to_entities(photos)
    
    pp.pprint(entities)
    show_photos(entities)
```

_[Command+s to save.]_

_[Control+backtick to switch focus to terminal: `python bats.py`]_

Flickr gave us some cute bats, but it also gave us the wrong kind of bat! That's why we need Cloud Vision API.

_[Control+backtick to switch focus to editor.]_

_[Arrow down and command+/ to comment out `pp.pprint(entities)` and `show photos`.]_

Before we go over how we'll classify our photos as bat or non-bat, let's look at the response from the Vision API.

_[Arrow down and uncomment `classify as resp only`.]_

####_Your code block should look like_

```
    pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter()

    photos = search_flickr("bat")
    entities = photos_to_entities(photos)
    
    # pp.pprint(entities)
    # show_photos(entities)

    classify_as_resp_only(["bat"], entities)
```

_[Command+s to save.]_

_[Control+backtick to switch focus to terminal: `python bats.py`]_

So, we have our label annotations: _[read labels]_.

(_[If possible]_ And we have our localized object annotations: _[read names]_.)

_[Control+backtick to switch focus to editor.]_

_[Comment out `classify as resp only`]_

_[Uncomment `classify as`]_

_[Control+g **169** Enter]_

This function, `classify as`, iterates over the entities. For each entity, it creates a Vision API Image object _[line 189]_ and puts that image on a request to detect labels and localize objects _[line 197]_.

Hopefully, we get back label annotations and object localizations.

Sometimes the response does not include the features we asked for &mdash; especially object localizations because sometimes the API can't detect any objects in the image &mdash; hence the if blocks _[line 209]_.

We take any labels and object names that we get and put them in a set, and we also transform those normalized verticies into coordinates that we can crop to later.

Now we come to our helper function, `is_a` _[line 224]_. It takes a list of terms &mdash; in our case, we'll pass a list with only one element, the word "bat" &mdash; as well as a collection of labels. `is_a` checks if "bat" is in that collection of labels and returns a boolean.

So, if it's not a bat, but we did get back crop coordinates, we're going to:

* crop the image to just that object _[line 228]_
* convert the cropped image from a Pillow Image to a Vision Image _[line 233]_ (Pillow is a fork of Python Image Library)
* and then make a new request to the Vision API to label our cropped image.

Hopefully, we get back new labels _[line 241]_. Then we:

* add them to our set
* check if we've found a bat yet
* if we have found a bat, we won't crop to the rest of the objects. We don't want to call the API if we don't have to.

Now that we've done what we can to identify the image as either bat or non-bat, we update the entity _[line 250]_ and mark it as having been classified.

_[Control+g **312** Enter]_

During this step, we're also going to write the entities to the datastore.

_[Uncomment `with ds client` block.]_

####_Your code block should look like_

```
    pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter()

    photos = search_flickr("bat")
    entities = photos_to_entities(photos)
    
    # pp.pprint(entities)
    # show_photos(entities)

    # classify_as_resp_only(["bat"], entities[3:6])

    classify_as(["bat"], entities)
    with ds_client.batch():
        ds_client.put_multi(entities)
```

_[Command+s to save.]_

_[Command+tab to Terminal: `python bats.py`]_

Great, we found {2} bats.

Time to tweet!

_[Control+backtick to switch focus to editor.]_

_[Comment out **everything** except initial `pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter()`]_

_[Arrow down and uncomment `query =`, `query.add`, `bats =`, `pp.print`]_

We're going to ask the datastore for all the bat photos. Then we're going to choose one and tweet it. For this case, loading a few entities into memory is not a big deal, but we could also make the query keys-only, then randomly choose the key and get just that entitity.

_[Uncomment `tweet photo entity`]_

####_Your code block should look like this_

```
    pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter()

    # photos = search_flickr("bat")
    # entities = photos_to_entities(photos)
    
    # pp.pprint(entities)
    # show_photos(entities)

    # classify_as_resp_only(["bat"], entities[3:6])

    # classify_as(["bat"], entities)
    # with ds_client.batch():
        # ds_client.put_multi(entities)

    # Get bats from Cloud Datastore.
    query = ds_client.query(kind="Photo")
    query.add_filter("is_bat", "=", True)
    bats = list(query.fetch())
    pp.pprint(bats)

    # Time to tweet!
    tweet_photo_entity(random.choice(bats))
```

_[Control+g **266** Enter]_

First, we're gonna write a message. What's the hashtag for this event? _[If possible, add after `#HappyHalloween`.]_

Then we're gonna upload the photo to Twitter _[line 282]_, and attach it and our message to our tweet.

Finally, we'll record when we tweeted in the datastore _[line 294]_. We can use this with a composite index to only pull bat photos that haven't been tweeted recently.

_[Command+s to save.]_

_[Command+tab to Terminal: `python bats.py`]_

_[Command+tab to Chrome. Next slide!]_

Let's see how it looks...

Awesome!

_[Estimated elapsed time: 20 minutes.]_

## Slide 31
### Additional GCP ML APIs

Flickr can return not just photos but also video. If you are dedicated to tweeting only the choicest cute animal _videos_, there are Google Cloud Platform APIs to help with that, too!

(One of the challenges of working with video is programatically detecting "good clips" &mdash; you know, interesting, not too long. Cloud Video Intelligence has a Shot Change Detection feature, which can help you roll your own clipping strategy.)

## Slide 32
### Further GCP Services

You may have noticed that our bats-to-Twitter script downloaded photos locally. That's not strictly required, but it may be part of your workflow, and you can always store images with Cloud Storage.

You have to host your bot somewhere. App Engine has a cron service, while Cloud Scheduler was announced back in July and is currently in alpha.

## Slide 33
### Alternatives to GCP

Or, disentangling from Google Cloud Platform's all-encompassing embrace for a moment, I'm currently hosting my bot at PythonAnyhwere, which is a great online IDE and web hosting service. If you like Python, check it out.

## Slide 34
### Twitter Changes

At the end of July, Twitter started requiring developers to answer a questionnaire about how they plan to use Twitter's API and its data before permitting developers to create an API key.

This _is_ a hoop to jump through, but you can do it.

(Also, Flickr already had a similar requirement, so I had my "Please just let me post cute animal photos" spiel ready.)

But maybe you're done with Twitter...

## Slide 35
### Mastodon

Mastodon is an open source, decentralized social network. It has a few nice design features &mdash; for example, you can't search arbitrary strings, so while you can still find posts via hashtags, it's harder for people to search something they want to fight about.

Plus, there's a Mastodon instance just for bots, BotsIn.Spaaaace!

My next mini-project will probably be updating @BeachBirbys to crosspost to Mastodon.

## Slide 36
### What do you want to see?

Thank you for listening. I hope that you feel inspired to mash together some APIs to create something that makes you smile.

## Slide 37
### Photo Credits

Thanks to the photographers who took these turtle, bird, and bat photos!

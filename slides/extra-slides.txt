Twitter is a site that can be a conduit for upsetting news, hard conversations, and harassment.

Yet I have not logged off.

But I do try to make my timeline a happier place by interleaving positive content.

Think about what would make the good chemical spray in your brain, and then build it.

Also, what you build doesn't have to post to Twitter! Twitter recently introduced a vetting process for apps, and I'll cover that, plus alternatives to Twitter, later in this presentation.

## Slide 5
### How will you find images?

This is a non-exhaustive list of APIs that you can use to find Creative Commons-licensed images.

I started with Flickr because I was familiar with it as an end-user. In the future, I may add more sources for my bot to pull from.

(Unsplash is a particularly good source for aesthetic photos. Their license is incredibly permissive: you can use Unsplash photos in commercial projects without credit; you just can't scrape their photos to create your own Unsplash.)

### Cloud Datastore
###### (technically Cloud Firestore in Datastore mode)

---

Cloud Datastore is a NoSQL database.

Now that it's built on top of Firestore, it's strongly consistent.

But because Firestore is in Datastore mode, real-time updates are not supported.

### Data Model

> Data objects are known as entities. An entity has one or more named properties, each of which can have one or more values. Entities of the same kind do not need to have the same properties, and an entity's values for a given property do not all need to be of the same data type.

### Composite Indexes

(And helpful error messages!)

```
google.api_core.exceptions.FailedPrecondition: 400 no matching
index found. recommended index is:
- kind: Photo
  properties:
  - name: is_bird
  - name: last_tweeted
```
